# Constraint Programming with JuMP

Tutorial "Constraint Programming with JuMP" given at [The 30th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming](https://cp2024.a4cp.org/).

## Software prerequisite

If you want to follow participate to the tutorial, you will have to install the necessary in your computer.
Install Julia, VS code and the Julia extension for VS code as detailed [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/julia#_getting-started). For installing Julia, I recommend doing it through [juliaup](https://julialang.org/downloads/#juliaup_-_julia_version_manager).

## Running the example

Open this folder with VS code. Then use "View" -> "Commande Palette" then write "Julia: Start REPL".
In the REPL, write `]` to enter Pkg mode and then write `activate .` in order to activate use your current directory as environment. Then run `instantiate`.
You can now leave the Pkg environment with a backspace.

Open the example now and run the lines with `Shift + Enter`.
